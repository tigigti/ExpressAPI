<h1>Node Express API Boilerplate</h1>

    This is a boilerplate structure for an API build on Express.
    It already includes authorization and database connection.
    You can tweak it according to your needs, but this is a pretty solid starting point.

<h1>Todo</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Add an example using the "verifyToken" middleware (protected route maybe?)</li>
</ul>
